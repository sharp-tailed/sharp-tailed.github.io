title: I tried many things, but..

I find that [Zettlr][1] \[_ˈset·lər_\] and [Zotero][2] make my life easier. I
have used it to make bibliographies with several papers now, all while
keeping a digital [Zettelkasten][3]. It just requires knowledge of Markdown
syntax and how to use Zettlr for note-taking. The best part is how easy it
is.

You just need to download the extension for Zotero which is what you will be
using to create citations – without having to install plugins on the website.
You simply open Zotero, create a "Collection", then you add references as you
browse. If you go to a link in your browser and click the "Save to Zotero"
button for the extension (it’s available for both Firefox and Chrome/Chromium
browsers), you can save multiple references in your Collection. This allows
you to, when done, simply export to a bibliography in various formats. It
makes note-taking a breeze and it improves your ability to read without
having to stop so often to manually write up your references and lookup
things. There is a very handy setting in Zotero that allows to import all
metadata for a certain DOI or arxiv number, just by pasting the number into
the "Add Item(s) by Identifier" button. It pulls all the information for you
in a second. No more manual references. The only thing is you will have to
manually set the reference pointers like I have done in this post. Numbering
and setting the #refs themselves is pretty easy, just create a numbered list
in the markdown editor or your IDE.
