title: On MSPs

First, let's note a couple things about them:  
1. paid to secure _your_ infrastructure - can't even secure _their_ infrastructure a majority of the time  
2. account for majority of large-scale attacks on FVEY by foreign gov  

So can they really be trusted with our nation's infrastructure?  

### Cold hard facts produce cold hard cash
- [GRU is performing brute force attacks since mid-2019](https://www.nsa.gov/Press-Room/Press-Releases-Statements/Press-Release-View/Article/2677750/nsa-partners-release-cybersecurity-advisory-on-brute-force-global-cyber-campaign/)
    - incredibly easy to brute force _en mass_
    - Russian General Staff Main Intelligence Directorate(GRU) 85<sup>th</sup>
      Main Special Service Center (GTsSS)

### MSPs don't use basic domain protections:
   - multi-layer security/restriction approach involving people and processes
   ([OSI Model](2022.0727.2129))
   - SSO (application and network layer)
   - a requirements engineering process [Zowghi2000ARE] [Faroom2019]
   - SPF and DMARC (e-mail threats)
   - network segregation
   - least privilege
   - depreciate obsolete accounts and processes
   - maintenance and updates regularly
   - rolling backups on-prem and in the cloud
   - _Mandatory Access Controls_ (SELinux, SSO, network permissions)

These truly are basic fundamentals of security and should be utilized at the
bare minimum by companies paid to protect the infrastructure and systems (e.g.,
applications and controllers) of SMB's and large companies. But they're just
not. Why?
